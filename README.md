# Serverless task queue

Material of the talk "Building a serverless task queue".

The goal of this project is to show different ways of building a serverless task queue using AWS Lambda and other AWS services.
Some pieces of the code are not ideal (eg. task registry) because I just wanted to make the code as simple as possible and just focus on building the task queue.
